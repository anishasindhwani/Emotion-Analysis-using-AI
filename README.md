# Emotion-Analysis-using-AI
AI-assisted emotion analysis allows computers to read non-verbal signs like body language and facial emotions. Facial expressions provide information about a person's emotional state and aid the regulation of discussions with that individual. Furthermore, these expressions enable a better knowledge of the person's overall mood. Social interactions and non-verbal communication rely heavily on facial expressions. Facial expression classification could be a useful tool in behavioural research and medical rehabilitation. Emotion Analysis entails visually identifying and analysing several facial key points in order to determine the underlying emotion.
